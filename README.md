A gaming distribution based on Arch Linux, with a linux-zen kernel and KDE Plasma.

Please note that the system image is still being checked and is not ready for the official release.
# Why Redvision OS?
Pleasant and easy to use. The interface of the system is not difficult. Thanks to RedCenter, it will be easier for you to use Linux. You can update packages, solve problems and much more!


It's fast and lightweight. It uses less than 1GB of RAM! The ISO image weighs 1.9GB and you only need 20GB of disk space!


Support from the developer or the community will help you solve any problems!

The OS is good, I ran it on a machine with MBR (Legacy)
The operating system is well optimized (the same Garuda Linux is very laggy), bad that inherited failure often hangs on purpose, but there is no idea what to do, also with the customization is very good theme looks cool.
